        <h1>My Favourite Sport</h1>
        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p>I love basketball because it is my hobby and it is good for my health.</p>
        <p>I go to basketball classes every evening. I learn new things there.</p>
        <p>It is an enjoyable and healthy sport which can bring us joy, foster better friendships and help us grow taller.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>My favourite basketball player is Stephen Curry</h3>
        <p>He is my favourite because he is very good in shooting.</p>
        <p>He plays in Golden State Warriors Team (GSW).</p>
